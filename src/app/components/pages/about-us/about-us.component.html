                        <p>Established in 2018, Waste Glass Recovery PTY Ltd embarked on a mission that transcends mere business objectives. Our purpose: to contribute significantly to a greener planet by recycling waste glass, reducing pollution, and fostering environmental consciousness.</p>
                        <p>In the nascent years, our operations spanned a broad spectrum of recyclable materials‚Äîscrap metal, plastic, and glass. However, destiny steered us toward a remarkable revelation: the soaring demand for glass recycling. With unwavering resolve, we recalibrated our focus exclusively to glass. Our journey began modestly, supplying 300 tons of glass per month to Consol. Today, we stand as a formidable force, handling a staggering 3000 tons monthly. Our reach extends beyond Gauteng; we traverse the entire province, collecting glass from every corner.</p>
